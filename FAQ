1.  Q:  Passwords!?  Authentication!?
    A:  Why delude yourself?  Adding a layer of obscurity like a
        password sent clear-text across the network is no more
        secure than renaming the CGI executable to azFFl.cgi
        (other than the name is likely logged where the password
         is not, but the people with the logs could easily get
         the password anyway)

2. Q: Why not HTun (http://htun.runslinux.net/) ?  This project
      is redundant!
   A: While HTun would be useful in some situations, it might
      not be applicable to others, for example, HTun requires
      you to be root on both ends of the connection.  HTun
      also requires a little more effort to setup.  However,
      if you need a full IP connection, HTun will be better
      for you.

3. Q: Why not SOHT (Sockets Over HTTP) ?  This project is
      redundant!
   A: Sockets Over HTTP (SOHT) is written in Java and requires a
      substantial amount more effort to setup if you don't already
      have the infrastructure for it in place.  Also, this software
      is or will be compatible with SOHT.
