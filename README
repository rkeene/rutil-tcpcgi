This package is useful for connecting to hosts reachable by a webserver
you have access to, but not reachable by you.  It allows you to use any
host you have CGI access to as a proxy.  This means if you can exec CGI
on a host, you can make connections from that host using TCP. Examples:

1. If you have a machine [www.test1.com] that can only recieve HTTP
   requests, but you want to make TCP connections to it on other ports
   you can use this package to do that.

2. It could also be used in a forward sense (though there might be
   better options, like HTTP CONNECT) if you were behind a firewall
   that only allows HTTP connections outbound.  You could setup a
   webserver that has CGI capabilities and put the CGI component on
   it.  Then on your firewalled side, run the client (tcpcgi), and
   connect anywhere you want.
